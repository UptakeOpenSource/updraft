Description: This package is intended to build and execute modular R
             workflows. UpDraft workflows are built through R6 classes and can be
             saved to disk in JSON format. UpDraft workflow execution supports
             both serial and parallel execution without a user needing to
             directly interface with a multiprocessing or scheduling library.
             Plus, UpDraft can visualize workflows. It's pretty cool.
