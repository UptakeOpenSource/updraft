Description: Many workflows in R can be expressed as graphs of distinct processing steps.
             Where these steps are independent of each other, there is an opportunity
             to parallelize execution. This is where updraft comes in. updraft workflows
             are built through R6 classes and can be saved to disk in JSON format.
             UpDraft workflow execution supports both serial and parallel execution
             without a user needing to directly interface with a multiprocessing or scheduling library.
             Plus, UpDraft can visualize workflows. It's pretty cool.
