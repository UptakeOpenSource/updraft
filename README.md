This package is intended to build and execute modular based R workflows. UpDraft workflows are built through R6 classes and can be saved to disk in JSON format. UpDraft workflow execution supports both serial and parallel execution without a user needing to directly interface with a multiprocessing or scheduling library. Plus, UpDraft can visualize workflows. It's pretty cool.

### Documentation
All public functions and R6 classes are Roxygen documented. 

Vignettes are coming soon!

### Status
Currently in an alpha state. Backwards compatibility not guaranteed until a 1.0 Release!
